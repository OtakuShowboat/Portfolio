		<h2>Otaku Blog</h2>
		<h3>SquareSpace Blog</h3>
		<p><a href="https://otakushowboat.com" target="_blank">https://otakushowboat.com</a></p><br />
		<p>A personal blog set up based on my online persona and brand, Otaku Showboat. The blog itself has evolved over time, originating as a Blogger blog, then converting to a WordPress blog, then to SquareSpace. It is my "first" website, and one I periodically update and continue to evolve.</p>

		<h2>Kansas Interdisciplinary Carbonates Consortium</h2>
		<h3>WordPress Overhaul</h3>
		<p><a href="http://carbonates.dept.ku.edu" target="_blank">http://carbonates.dept.ku.edu</a></p><br />
		<p>I was originally hired to upgrade and maintain this official website of KICC. The original website used a dated theme, the content was outdated, and the security was in need of improvement. I updated it with a more modern, customized theme with mobile optimization, improved security, and updated the content. I continue to maintain its content and perform regular updates.</p>

		<h2>KU Ichnology</h2>
		<h3>Static Website Overhaul</h3>
		<p><a href="http://ichnology.ku.edu" target="_blank">http://ichnology.ku.edu</a></p><br />
		<p>The first site I was hired to work on, the KU Ichnology website was originally worked on over many years by several Geology students. When I first started working on the site, there were several issues, from broken videos and styling to duplicates of the site within the site file structure. I did a complete overhaul of the site while maintaining the original link structure and improving the overall user experienceon desktop and mobile. I continue to maintain this site as part of my work with KICC.</p>
